NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Stash::GitHub - The great new Dist::Zilla::Stash::GitHub!

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.001 of Dist::Zilla::Stash::GitHub -
    released May 10, 2015 as part of Dist-Zilla-Stash-GitHub.

SYNOPSIS

        # in your ~/.dzil/config.ini
        [%GitHub]
        username = RsrchBoy
        password = la la la la la

DESCRIPTION

    Right now, a bog-standard, simple little stash to keep one github token
    in a central location... As everything seems to be looking for one in
    different places, or keeping their own somewhere.

    Ideally, this will be less zombie-like in the not-too-distant future,
    and if the id/token information is not embedded in one's
    ~/.dzil/config.ini it will be looked for in the usual suspect
    locations.

ATTRIBUTES

 username

    String, read-write-private, required.

    The GitHub username. 'user' or 'id' will be accepted as aliases.

 password

    String, read-write-private, required.

    The user's password. Or, preferably, a distinct identity token.
    Seriously.

    'token' will be accepted as an alias.

TODO

    * "Get smarter" about looking up our github id/token.

    * Keep our id/token in a distinct config file (optionally?)
